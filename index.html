    <div class="container">
        <h2>John’s Tractor Building Project</h2>
        <p>Imagine John, an aspiring engineer with a vision to build a tractor from scratch. Here’s how he used Idea.com to make it happen:</p>
        <ul class="example-steps">
            <li>
                <strong>Step 1: Share Your Vision</strong> - John starts by submitting his project on Idea.com. He describes his goal of designing and building a fully functional tractor to help small-scale farmers improve productivity. He explains his passion for engineering and how he hopes his tractor will make a difference in rural agriculture.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 2: Receive Essential Support</strong> - With John’s project accepted, Idea.com helps him cover part of his rent and grocery expenses. This financial support allows him to focus on developing his tractor prototype without the burden of full-time work, giving him more time to invest in his project.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 3: Gain Visibility and Attract Opportunities</strong> - As John works on his tractor, he shares updates, photos, and milestones on his Idea.com profile. His progress catches the eye of agricultural experts and potential collaborators who are excited to help him bring his vision to life. With increased visibility, John gains access to resources, advice, and potential funding to refine his project.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 4: Achieve Success and Pay It Forward</strong> - After months of hard work, John completes his prototype and partners with a local manufacturing company to bring his tractor design to market. To show his appreciation, John contributes 20% of his first income from this partnership back to Idea.com, helping fund the next round of passion-driven projects.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This example illustrates how each step of the Idea.com process supports users like John—from financial assistance to gaining visibility and connecting with collaborators, all the way to achieving their goals and paying it forward. By joining Idea.com, you could also take your passion project from an idea to a real-world impact.</p>
